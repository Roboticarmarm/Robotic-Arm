2. arm.ino-Basic control sample code for Arduino Mega2560
3. serial.ino-Serial base sample code for Arduino Mega2560
4. mainarm.sh-Beta version for RK3188 (hand)
5. mainarm.ino-Beta version for Arduino Mega2560

-------------------------TASK LIST------------------------
5/15
For mopplayer : Startup
Basic control for RK3188 and Mega2560.
Testing done.
----

5/22
For mopplayer : Rebuild sirius system for RK3188
ISSUE: 
For testing voice, it spent about 6X secs on
recognition.
Using GCC 4.8.2 is not recommended by office,
they say it will crash.
Retry to build system by using GCC 4.9.3.
----

5/29
For mopplayer : System has been finished
GCC 4.9.3 will cause some bug on program, drop it
Using GCC 4.8.2 to rebuild ASR to minimize space.
11G -> 2.5G for space requirement.
Testing done.
----

5/30
For mopplayer : Review control method
ISSIUE:
if use GPIOs to control the servos, we will need
2x17 GPIOs to encode only 4 angels of the servos
I make it more flexible...
----

5/31
For mopplayer : Change GPIOs to Serial
I coded the serial of base, it use ttyUSB to
emulate serial. I also tried UART, but there are
some bugs on sync, so drop it.
Push serial code, it will be combined.
----

6/4
For mopplayer : Release beta version for host
This beta version is only for hand control,
only uses linux host to control,
and doesn't involve voice recognition.
It supported a "hold" operation.
----

6/5
For mopplayer : GCC issiue solved
Now waiting for New configured GCC 4.9.3.
ISSUE:
The robotic arm is overloaded by the torque 
of the base servo, it need time to solve.
----

6/12
For mopplayer: Hardware review
ISSIUE:
The robotic arm is modified to move horizontally,
but the strcture is still weak, we will add screws to fix this.

6/24
For mopplayer: Simplify arm
Basic hold control
Done.

6/29
For mopplayer : car go and grap
version 1.0 release
Done.
 
7/2
For mopplayer : Refine the control
version 1.1 release
Done.
