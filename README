-------------------------TASK LIST------------------------
5/15
For mopplayer : Startup
Basic control for RK3188 and Mega2560.
Testing done.
----

5/22
For mopplayer : Rebuild sirius system for RK3188
ISSUE: 
For testing voice, it spent about 6X secs on
recognition.
Using gcc 4.8.2 is not recommended by office,
they say it will crash.
Retry to build system by using gcc 4.9.3.
----

5/29
For mopplayer : System has been finished
gcc 4.9.3 will cause some bug on program, drop it
Using gcc 4.8.2 to rebuild ASR to minimize space.
11G -> 2.5G for space requirement.
Testing done.

5/30
For mopplayer : Review control method
ISSIUE:
if use GPIOs to control the servos, we will need
2x17 GPIOs to encode only 4 angels of the servos
I make it more flexible...

5/31
For mopplayer : Change GPIOs to Serial
I coded the serial of base, it use ttyUSB to
emulate serial. I also tried UART, but there are
some bugs on sync, so drop it.
Push serial code, it will be combined.
